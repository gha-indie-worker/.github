# Security policy

Do not publish exploit details, secrets, customer data, or private infrastructure information in a public issue. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when enabled, or contact an organization owner through a private authenticated channel. Include the affected repository and revision, impact, reproduction conditions, and a minimal remediation suggestion.

## Durable engineering policy

- This repository defines public organization-wide defaults for `gha-indie-worker`.
- Never commit credentials, private keys, access tokens, customer data, or private-repository inventories.
- Resolve Git conflicts semantically: inspect both sides, the merge base, nearby tests and contracts, and normally 3–10 relevant prior commits. Never blindly select all of `ours` or all of `theirs`.
- Prefer focused pull requests, explicit validation, non-destructive Git operations, and documented tradeoffs.
- Cross-repository integration uses versioned interfaces, APIs, SDKs, events, or explicitly owned replicated read models. Services do not reach into another service's database by default.
- `*-infra` repositories and `*-monorepo` application source remain separate. A `*-infra` repository must never appear as a Git submodule under `*-monorepo/apps`.
- Git submodules are reserved for explicitly coordinated editable source composition. Zed packages or immutable artifacts are preferred for package dependencies. Production deploys immutable artifacts or OCI digests, not source clones.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do **not** open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability, exposed credential, authentication bypass, data leak, or sensitive infrastructure weakness.

Use private vulnerability reporting from the **Security** tab of the affected repository when available. Otherwise contact the organization owners through an established private operational channel and identify the affected repository, impact, reproduction conditions, and a safe contact method. Provide only the minimum evidence needed; do not include live credentials, private keys, customer data, or destructive proof-of-concept payloads.

## Handling exposed credentials

Treat any credential pasted into chat, logs, commits, issues, pull requests, build artifacts, screenshots, or test fixtures as compromised. Stop using it, revoke or rotate it, replace dependent configuration, and audit recent use. Removing a secret from the latest file does not invalidate it or erase earlier copies. Repository-history rewriting requires exact authorization and coordinated review.

## Supported versions and response expectations

Each repository documents its own supported versions. No service-level response commitment is implied by this fallback policy. Maintainers should acknowledge valid reports privately, limit access, preserve evidence, coordinate remediation, test the fix, rotate affected secrets, and disclose responsibly when appropriate.
